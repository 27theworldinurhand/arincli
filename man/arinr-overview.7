.SH "NAME"
\fBarinr\-overview\fR \- An overview of the ARINr scripts
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
ARINr is a set of Ruby scripts that utilize both the Whois\-RWS(7) service and the Reg\-RWS(7) service\. Whois\-RWS(7) is ARIN\'s Whois/NICNAME RESTful web service for exposing IP network and ASN registration data to the public (Note this service pre\-dates the IETF WEIRDS/RDAP service and is not yet compatible with that specification)\. Reg\-RWS(7) is ARIN\'s registration RESTful web service available to customers of ARIN\.
.
.P
At the time of this writing, the ARINr scripts should be considered \fBalpha\fR quality\. A lot of functionality is still missing from the scripts, and ARIN has not conducted any qualified degree of quality assurance against them\.
